# Library Terminal App

## Intro
This project was made as a training in Java, it allows you to simulate some library basic operations that will be explained in further details below. 

## Implementation
For this project I decided to represent the most important aspects of a library, creating 4 classes.
- Author: Has basic information about the author of a book, composed by name, email and gender. It allows you to modify the email if necessary.
- Book: This class allows you to relate the book with the respective authors, set a title, price or quantity and change them.
- Library: This one allows you to operate with the books and the authors, load them from two separated files and it uses a HashMap internally.
- LibraryGUI: It's main functionality is to connect the operations done in the other classes with the user, displaying the info. 

## Execution
To execute the program you must run the main method of the LibraryGUI.
